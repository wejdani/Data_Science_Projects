    "There is a famous problem in statistics that concerns a room full of people: Same Birthday!\n",
    "\n",
    "An instructor offers a prize of $$20 dollars to anyone who thinks that two people in the room have the same birthday. Your assignment is to build a Monte Carlo simulation to tell the instructor how many people need to be in the room to give him/her a better than 50 chance of winning the $20. That is to say, how many people need to be in a room in order for the probability of two of them having the same birthday is greater than 50%. Do the same for 95% and 99%.\n",
