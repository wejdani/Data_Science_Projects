# Membership perks: 

# 1) 3 movies per week

# 2) 2 free snacks per visit

# 3) point and reward system: 
#   - How to gain points? 
#     1) Everytime you renew you get 10 points 
#     2) Everytime you renew on a consecutive streak you get 3 extra points per month and it adds up till 6 months 
#     (first month: 10, second month: 13, third month: 16, fourth month: 19, fifth month: 22, sixth month: 25, for a total = 105 for six months), after six months its a 25 point increase per month streak after
#     As an incentive to bring people back every month we added this system so the customer can gather more points. 
#     The more consecutive uninterrupted months they resubscribe the more points they gather
#     
#   - Rewards: 
#     1) one Extra movie = 25 points  
#     2) one Extra snack = 5 points  
#     3) 10% discount = 10 points  

# 4 - vouchers you can use or give to someone else worth (5 dollars)

# 5 - one free voucher and snacks on your birthday
